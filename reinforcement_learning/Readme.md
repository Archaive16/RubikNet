# Reinforcement Learning ðŸš€  

## ðŸ§  What is Reinforcement Learning?  
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of **machine learning** where an **agent** learns by **interacting with an environment**.  
The agentâ€™s goal is to take the **best actions** to maximize its long-term rewards.  

Unlike **Supervised Learning** (where the model learns from labeled data), RL is about:  
- **Trial and Error** â€“ The agent tries different actions.  
- **Feedback from Rewards** â€“ The environment gives positive or negative rewards.  
- **Learning a Policy** â€“ Over time, the agent figures out the best way to act.  


## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts  

- **Agent** â†’ The learner/decision-maker (e.g., a robot, a game player).  
- **Environment** â†’ The world the agent interacts with (e.g., a game, simulation).  
- **State (s)** â†’ The situation the agent is currently in.  
- **Action (a)** â†’ The choice the agent can make.  
- **Reward (r)** â†’ Feedback from the environment after an action.  
- **Policy (Ï€)** â†’ The strategy that maps states to actions.  
- **Episode** â†’ A sequence of states, actions, and rewards that ends when the task finishes.  

ðŸ‘‰ The agentâ€™s job is to **learn the best policy** to maximize cumulative rewards.  



## ðŸ“š Types of Reinforcement Learning  

1. **Model-Free RL** â€“ Agent directly learns from trial & error  
   - Example: Monte Carlo Methods, Q-Learning  
2. **Model-Based RL** â€“ Agent builds a model of the environment and plans ahead  
   - Example: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
