# RubikNet
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Rubik’s Cube Solving with Stepper Motor Apparatus

## Project Domains:
Reinforcement Learning, Python Programming, Robotics Simulation

## Project Description
This project will introduce us to physical systems based RL-policy networks and logic solvers by building a system that can solve a Rubik’s Cube. Starting with a 2x2 cube and progressing to the standard 3x3, students will develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL) agent capable of learning optimal sequences of moves to solve the cube from any scrambled state.
The learned move sequences will be executed by a low-cost robotic setup driven by stepper motors and controlled via an ESP32 microcontroller. Along the way, we will gain hands-on experience in Python, RL frameworks, reward engineering, computer vision for cube state recognition, and embedded systems programming.
By the end of the project, we will have a working pipeline that connects decision-making AI with real-world actuation—a complete software-to-hardware system.
