# RubikNet 🧩

RubikNet is a project exploring how AI and robotics can solve the Rubik’s Cube using **Reinforcement Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **Search-based Solvers**.  
This repository is organized into three main components:

---

## 📂 Reinforcement Learning
This folder contains our experiments with **RL agents** trained on classic control environments.  
We have implemented and solved the following environments:  

- 🏗 **CartPole** – balancing a pole on a cart  
- 🚕 **Taxi** – navigating a taxi to pick up and drop passengers  
- 🚙 **MountainCar** – driving a car up a steep hill with limited power  
- 🃏 **Blackjack** – learning strategies for the card game using Monte Carlo methods  

These experiments build the foundation for applying RL to more complex tasks like solving the Rubik’s Cube.

## 📂 Deep Learning
This folder is designed as a **introduction** on deep learning.  
- Covers the basics of **neural networks** and how they learn.  
- Hands-on projects on:  
  - **Digit Recognition (MNIST)**  
  - **Fashion Classification (Fashion-MNIST)**  
- Helps build the foundation needed before moving on to Reinforcement Learning and Cube Solvers.

## 📂 Cube Solver
This folder contains the **solver logic** for the Rubik’s Cube.  
- Includes **BFS/MCTS-based solvers** and classical search approaches.  
- Can be used standalone to find solutions to scrambled states.  
- Forms the backbone for testing learned models against logical solvers.

## 🚀 Usage
We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for environment management.  
To set up the project:  

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
pip install uv

# Sync dependencies
uv sync
```
