# Deep Learning ðŸ¤–  

## ðŸ§  What is Deep Learning?  
Deep Learning is a subfield of **Machine Learning** inspired by how the human brain works.  
It uses **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** to learn patterns from data and make predictions.  

Unlike traditional ML (which needs hand-crafted features), Deep Learning automatically learns **features + representations** from raw data (like images, audio, or text).

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts  

- **Neuron** â†’ The smallest unit of a neural network (like a biological brain cell).  
- **Layer** â†’ A collection of neurons stacked together.  
- **Activation Function** â†’ Introduces non-linearity (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).  
- **Loss Function** â†’ Measures the error between predictions and true values.  
- **Backpropagation** â†’ The algorithm that adjusts weights to minimize loss.  
- **Epochs** â†’ One full pass over the dataset during training.  

ðŸ‘‰ The network learns by adjusting its weights step by step using **Gradient Descent**(Process fo reducing the loss function).
